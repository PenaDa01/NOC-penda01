## NOC as a Service
This Service is an overview on what the NOC (Network Operation Center) does on a daily basis
## The Process
The NOC is the central communication center for technical engagement and support. The NOC will Recieve thousands of emails a day ranging anything from alerts from systems being down to passwords reset. The NOC also deals with hands on supoort with our data center we have located in the building.
 
## Creating Severities
Creating Severities or "sevs" is an important role for NOC. Severities are a document that we fill out when a product or server is not working properly as it should. The range of the severity depends on what is not working and how and who is affected in the failing product or server. It ranged from 1 to 3 and then theres customer and internal sevs. One being the worst we would need to create something called a bridge line to connect the responible teams who can fix whatever the issue may be.
